# db-migration-machine

Helps to load data from one database to another with jdbc.

Iterates over a target schema and loads appropriate data from a source schema.

Relies on convention over configuration, i.e. there's no option to suppress tables.

Custom functions and all database specifics are ignored. 
The use-case I had in mind was proof-of-concepts for new databases.

You might download the jdbc-driver from Microsoft by yourself or try the jTDS driver.
In general jTDS works better, but for some use-cases the Microsoft driver has its 
advantages.
